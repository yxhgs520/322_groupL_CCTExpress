AI-enabled online restaurant order and delivery system

To develop an online smart (LLM-based, no demand for LLM quality, any free ones available from Ollama/Hugging face will do - **NOTE: Already installed Ollama and llama3:8b on my laptop**) restaurant order and delivery system so that the restaurant can provide menus of food, customers browse and order the food from the menu, and delivery people of the restaurant deliver the food.
In this system, there are three groups of users:
1.	Employees: 
a)	at least two chefs who independently decide the menus and make the dish;
b)	at least two delivery people for food delivery
c)	One manager who processes customer registrations, handles customer compliments and complaints, hires/fires/raises/cuts pay for chef(s) and delivery people.
d)	Provide knowledge about this restaurant saved in the local knowledge base
2.	Customers:
a)	Registered customers who can browse/search, order, and vote (lowest 1 star to highest 5 stars) food delivered (on food and delivery quality/manners individually); can start/participate in a discussion topic on chefs/dishes/delivery people.
b)	Registered customers become VIP after spending more than $100 or making 3 orders as registered customers without outstanding complaints. They will receive 5% discount on their ordinary orders and 1 free delivery for every 3 orders, have access to specially developed dishes, and their complaints/compliments are counted twice as important as ordinary ones. 
c)	Provide opinions and observations as customers to the local knowledge base
3.	Visitors: who can browse the menus, ask questions about the food and restaurant, and apply to be registered customers.
System features:
1.	Overall: Provide a GUI, not necessarily web-based, with pictures to show the descriptions of each dish and price; each registered customer/VIP has a password to log in. When they log in, based on the history of their prior choices, different registered customers/VIP will have different most ordered and highest rated items. For new customers or visitors, the most popular dish and the highest-rated dishes are listed on the first page. The picture(s) of the most ordered and top-rated chef(s) (may or may not be the same chef). A text area (chat box) is given for any user to ask questions about the restaurant and food with local knowledge.
2.	Reputation management: A customer can file complaints/compliments to the chef of the food s/he purchased and deliver person who delivered the dish or other customers who didn’t behave in the discussion forums. The delivery person can complain/compliment customers s/he delivered dishes to; all complaints/compliments are handled by the manager. The person has the right to dispute the complaint; the manager made the final call to dismiss the complaint or let the warning stay and inform the impacted parties. Customers/delivery people whose complaints are decided to be without merit by the manager will receive one additional warning. Registered customers with 3 warnings are deregistered. VIPs having 2 warnings are put back to registered customers (with warnings cleared). The warnings should be displayed on the page when the customer logs in.
3.	Finance management: Every customer should deposit some money into the system. If the price of the order is more expensive than the deposited money in the account, the order is rejected, and the customer receives one warning automatically for being reckless.
4.	Human resources: Customers who are kicked out of the system or choose to quit the system will be handled by the manager: clear the deposit and close the account. And a kicked-out customer is on the blacklist of the restaurant: they cannot register anymore. The chef whose dishes received consistently low ratings (<2) or 3 complaints will be demoted (with a lower salary); a chef demoted twice is fired. Conversely, a chef whose dishes receive high ratings (>4) or 3 compliments will receive a bonus. One compliment can be used to cancel one complaint. The delivery people are handled the same way. The delivery people will compete to deliver the order by bidding; the manager assigns the order based on bidding results: the one with the lowest delivery price is generally chosen; if the one with a higher asking price is chosen, the manager should write a memo in the system as justification. 
5.	AI-based customer service: The system tries to answer the questions from local knowledge base, if no answers found, then delegates to an LLM(local Ollama3:8b model). If the response to a question in the chat box comes from the local knowledge base, the inquirer is asked to provide a rating. If the rating is 0 (outrageous), the answer will be flagged for the manager to check: if the content is really bad, this item will be removed, and the author will not be allowed to provide any answer.
6.	Creative feature: efficient route planning for delivery.(Openrouteservice API still configuring..)
